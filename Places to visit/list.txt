some good places to visit in Varanasi are-
-Vishwanath Temple-Though it looks like just another temple , on going inside you'll find yourself wrong.
 the scenic that you get from its first floor is awesome and the place is so quiet that you will not want to go from there.
 also , to refresh yourself, you can grab a cold coffee at the cafes near VT.
-Sarnath Temple-Visiting this place, you'll find yourself close to nature. The peaceful environment here will surely have a 
calming effect on you.
-Assi ghat-This is the favourite spot of students for a night out. A Saturday night spent beside the Ganga is the best of all experiences.
Other places to visit are
-Shivala
-Kashi Vishwanath Temple
-Dashashwamedh ghat etc.
