This waterfall is a kind of hidden treasure in a jungle! 
It is located in Chandrprabha wild life sanctuary which is around 60 mts drive from Varanasi.
Visit during monsoon (July-August) to witness the full flow of the falls. 
But you have to take an adventurous walk into the jungle about 3 km through tough tracks to get mesmerized by the beautiful roaring falls from the edge of rocky mountain cave.
Mostly people in groups spend time at the entrance of the jungle where one can easily take bath in the calm streams, cook and eat around the streams.
The sad part is that people litter the area and leaving the place to remain very dirty and clumsy with plastic wastes all around. 
Shops are available at the main entrance. 
If protected and maintained properly this can be a best place to chill out the weekend for all.
