Major Achievements
Abhishek Kumar, Rakesh Kumar Misra, and Devender Singh "Improving the local search capability of Effective Butterfly Optimizer using Covariance Matrix Adapted Retreat phase" (EBO with CMAR)
EBO with CMAR was a first ranked algorithm in competition on real-parameter bound-constrained single objective optimization at IEEE Congress in Evolutionary Computation (CEC-2017), Spain.
There was 12 world class algorithms are shortlisted for final comparison. EBO with CMAR got 100 out of 100 score in finals.
Second Indian algorithm reached this mark in the history of CEC competition.
