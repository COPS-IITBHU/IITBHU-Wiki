Historical Background:
The Department is currently offering Bachelor, Master and Doctoral degree programmes. It had been recognized as Centre of Advanced Study in 1980 and presently running into the IVth phase of this status. The National Electron Microscope Facility (NELMIF) was established through the generous grant of DST in 1982. The Department is also a Centre of QIP programme of MHRD/AICTE since 1981. The members of staff have been actively engaged in research and have undertaken many research/cons ultancy projects. These research activities span over wide ranging fields of nanomaterials characterization, quasicrystals, biomaterials, magnetic materials, spray forming, rapid solidification, mechanical alloying, powder metallurgy, modeling of phase diagram by CVM, phase transformation in steels and nonferrous alloys and structure property correlations, creep and fatigue behaviour of materials, nanoindentation, corrosion, thermodynamics of alloys and semiconducting intermetallics, pyrometallurgy of sulphide minerals, preparation of molycarbides, processing of ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, foundry and welding, wear studies of composites, waste utilization and energy management etc.
