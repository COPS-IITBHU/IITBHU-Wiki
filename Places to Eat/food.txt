Deena Chaat Bhandar
Varanasi is famous for its own style of chaat:  dahi bhalla, tamatar ki chaat and palak chaat.  
There are two outlets of Deena’s but the one near Dashashwamedha Ghat is more popular. 
The tamatar chaat is finely cut tomatoes mashed up with spices, while the palak chaat has crispy batter 
fried spinach leaves served with dahi, sev, sweetened tamarind chutney and spicy green chutney. The dahi bhalla 
is a sweeter version of what you get on Delhi’s streets – it has a generous sprinkling of raisins that lends it a sweetened taste.
