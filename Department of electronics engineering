Department of Electronics Engineering came into existence as an offshoot of Electrical Engineering Department in the year 1971
(when Banaras Engineering College, College of Mining and Metallurgy and College of Technology had been amalgamated to form the
Institute of Technology in its present form). The intake every year of the Department is 79 in the B.Tech. level and 47 in the
M.Tech. level. Besides teaching students of our own discipline (Electronics Engineering), we also offer the basic courses in 
Electronics Engineering to almost all the Departments of the Institute, we also teach advanced-level courses to the students
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering Departments. We have a training and placement section in the Institute 
through which most of our students are professionally placed in various jobs.
