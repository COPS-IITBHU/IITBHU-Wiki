faccha : first yearites
sab lite hai: everything is cool
lc :limbdi corner 
bakar : timepass (depends on situation)
Fakka: Adj. This is used to refer to F grade (equivalent to failing a course).
      You will often here folks talking "yaar fakka lag rha hai iss course me"
GPL: Noun. Abbreviations for 'G***d Pe Laat'. First gift you will receive on 
     your birthday (if you are a guy obviously and staying in campus on your birthday) 
     or any other occasion where you have achieved something that your friends haven't.
     Well, there's definitely more joy in giving than in receiving :P  
Tut: Noun. Abbreviations for Tutorial, a practice problem sheet given by professors 
     (topic wise generally). Well, I must uncover a hack here - most of the questions
      in our exams are on a similar pattern as in tuts but trust me, its not easy to 
      do these tuts or else everyone here would be a 9 pointer. FYI, a CGPA of 8 or 
      above is considered decent by IIT standards,         
Kholu: Noun. Used to refer to the branch opener.
Lite/Chill: Verb, used as an Adj too. I guess its one of the most used word in IITian's gossips,
      so much so that even your family get used to it :P It is a versatile word and used in many
      contexts. If someone says you to "chill/lite!", they are asking you to relax and chill out.
      You will often here folks saying "chill/lite hai" meaning "theek hai" or "koi tension nhi hai".
      Also, when people say "ye prof/course chill/lite hai", what they mean is that you don't have
     too much effort to sail through the course.
